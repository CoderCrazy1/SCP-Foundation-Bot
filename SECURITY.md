## Supported Versions

These are the current versions of the bot that we support. Any version that is marked with :x: is not updated and any reports for that version will be declined.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to [codercrazy@codercrazy.com](mailto:codercrazy@codercrazy.com) if you find a vulnerability with our bot. We will work in order to fix the issue ASAP. Please do not disclose the issue until it has been patched. We cannot update self-hosted or custom implimentations of our bot, and can only patch vulnerabilities on the official versions. If you find a self-hosted version of our bot that still has a vulnerability, we would recommend informing the maintainer that they need to update.
